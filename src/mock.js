export const faqs = [
  {
    id: 1,
    question: "What's the difference between RRSP and TFSA contributions?",
    answer: "RRSP contributions are tax-deductible and reduce your taxable income for the year, but withdrawals are taxed. TFSA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but all growth and withdrawals are tax-free. We help determine the best strategy based on your income and retirement goals."
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    question: "How do HST and GST work for small businesses in Canada?",
    answer: "If your business revenue exceeds $30,000 annually, you must register for HST/GST. You collect tax on sales and remit it to CRA, but can claim Input Tax Credits (ITCs) on business expenses. We handle all HST/GST filing and ensure you're maximizing your credits."
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    question: "What should I do if I'm being audited by CRA?",
    answer: "Don't panic! We provide full audit support and representation. We'll review your records, communicate with CRA on your behalf, and ensure your rights are protected. Our experience with CRA audits means you're in expert hands."
  },

    id: 4,
    question: "Can you help with cross-border tax issues?",
    answer: "Yes! We specialize in cross-border tax matters including US-Canada tax treaty benefits, foreign income reporting (T1135), and FBAR requirements. Whether you have US rental income or work remotely for a US company, we've got you covered."
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    question: "When are the tax filing deadlines in Canada?",
    answer: "For individuals, the deadline is April 30th. Self-employed individuals have until June 15th to file (but any balance owing is due April 30th). Corporate tax returns are due 6 months after fiscal year-end. We ensure all deadlines are met to avoid penalties."
  },
